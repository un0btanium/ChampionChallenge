			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Why does it say that i am having zero mastery points?
				p Every summoner starts the challenge at zero champion mastery points. This allows everybody a fresh and fair start. Perform well in games, win games and queue up with friends (party bonus) to win more points.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Do i have to update my points manually?
				p Yes, you do. Come back after you played a game or before the challenge ends and update your profile via the 'Update' button. There currently is no automatic update at the end of a challenge.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 How many times am i able to update my profile?
				p There is no limitations other than a 30 minute cooldown between updates. That is about one game length, so feel free to update after every game.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Can i enter and update other summoners?
				p Sure, but that would increase the competition for you :P<br>Feel free to check your friends points though.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 I just played a game it says zero points?
				p You have to enter the challenge first, then play your games. Games played before you entered the challenge do not count. If you search your summoner for the first time, it may be that you automatically enter the challenge. But after the first time you have to enter each challenge manually.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 I entered my summoner and i already have points?
				p Apparently someone else has applied you into the challenge already. There is no real drawback. You should thank him :)
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Why does the final rank differ from the estimated one?
				p The final rank calculations at the end of a challenge take into consideration that multiple summoners may have gained the same amount of points. These summoners share the same rank and therefore boost your own in the process. The estimated one does not check for duplicate points. Furthermore, if a summoner never updates his profile up until right before the challenge ends, effects all ranks below this summoner.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Do i receive an item as achievement multiple times?
				p No. However the item updates itself if your rank in the current challenge is higher than the rank it currently shows. This enables you to updated the item to a rare golden item.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Do items have different values?
				p Yes. Items which have a small gold cost in-game are usually much more rare. If you see an Healthpotion in the next challenge comming up, be sure that a lot of people may race for it.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Why does each champion have a different item as a reward?
				p Some players like hunting achievements and this enables them to choose for which items they want to race. The champion-item constellations over some nice consideration about which champion or item to choose.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Is the website's source code somewhere?
				p Yes, you can find the source code over at <a href="https://github.com/un0btanium/ChampionChallenge">GitHub</a>. This website was created and part of the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/eoq3tZd1">Riot API Challenge 2016</a>.
			div(class="faq-question")
				h2 Which software did you use to create the website?
